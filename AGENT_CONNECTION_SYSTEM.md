# Agent-Level Connection System

## Overview
The Orchestration Designer now supports both **block-level** and **agent-level** connections, giving you fine-grained control over how agents communicate within complex orchestration workflows.

## Connection Modes

### ðŸ”„ Simple Mode (Block-Level)
- **Default mode** for quick workflow creation
- Connects entire orchestration blocks together
- Output from all agents in the source block flows to all agents in the target block
- Gray connection lines with solid arrows
- Connection handles appear at the bottom (output) and top (input) of blocks

**Use Case:** When you want a Sequential block to feed all its output to a Parallel block

### âš¡ Advanced Mode (Agent-Level)
- **Fine-grained control** for complex workflows
- Connect specific agents within blocks to other agents or blocks
- Each agent in a block shows:
  - **Left handle (â—‹)**: Input connection point
  - **Right handle (â—‹)**: Output connection point
- Blue dashed connection lines with blue arrows
- Agent handles appear on the left/right edges of the block

**Use Case:** When you want Agent 2 in a Sequential block to specifically feed into Agent 1 in a Parallel block

## Visual Indicators

### Connection Types
- **Block connections**: Gray/dark gray smooth curved lines with 'B' label
- **Agent connections**: Blue dashed curved lines with 'A' label
- **Arrowheads**: Point in the direction of data flow
- **Delete button**: Circle with minus icon on the curve (click to remove)
- **Curved connectors**: Flexible Bezier curves that adapt to block positioning
- **Top layer rendering**: Connections appear above blocks for maximum visibility

### Connection Handles
- **Inactive**: Gray circles
- **Active source**: Blue circles (when starting a connection)
- **Hover**: Scale up and turn blue
- **Tooltip**: Hover to see "Connect input/output to this agent"

## How to Use

### Creating Block-Level Connections
1. Set connection mode to **Simple** (toggle at top-left)
2. Click "Connect" button on any block (starts connection from that block)
3. Click "Connect" button on target block (completes connection)
4. Connection appears from source block bottom â†’ target block top

### Creating Agent-Level Connections
1. Set connection mode to **Advanced** (toggle at top-left)
2. Blocks expand to show all agents with left/right connection handles
3. Click the **right handle (â—‹)** of any agent to start connection
4. Click the **left handle (â—‹)** of any target agent to complete connection
5. Connection appears from source agent right â†’ target agent left

### Mixing Connection Types
You can freely mix block-level and agent-level connections in the same design:
- Sequential Block â†’ (block-level) â†’ Parallel Block
- Agent in Parallel â†’ (agent-level) â†’ Agent in Router Block
- Router Block â†’ (block-level) â†’ Hierarchical Block

## Connection Data Model

```typescript
interface Connection {
  id: string;
  source: string;           // Source block ID
  target: string;           // Target block ID
  sourceAgent?: string;     // Source agent ID (agent-level only)
  targetAgent?: string;     // Target agent ID (agent-level only)
  type: 'block' | 'agent';  // Connection type
}
```

## Advanced Workflows

### Example 1: Sequential â†’ Parallel with Agent Routing
```
Sequential Block (3 agents)
  â”œâ”€ Agent 1 (Data Collector) â”€â”€â†’ Parallel Agent A (Analyzer)
  â”œâ”€ Agent 2 (Preprocessor)   â”€â”€â†’ Parallel Agent B (Validator)  
  â””â”€ Agent 3 (Filter)          â”€â”€â†’ Parallel Agent C (Transformer)
```

### Example 2: Debate â†’ Router with Selective Routing
```
Debate Block (2 agents)
  â”œâ”€ Agent 1 (Pro Arguer)    â”€â”€â†’ Router (Decision Agent)
  â””â”€ Agent 2 (Con Arguer)    â”€â”€â†’ Router (Decision Agent)
     Router Agent            â”€â”€â†’ Sequential Chain A (High Priority)
                            â””â”€â”€â†’ Sequential Chain B (Low Priority)
```

### Example 3: Hierarchical with Nested Chains
```
Hierarchical Block
  â”œâ”€ Manager Agent           â”€â”€â†’ Sequential Chain 1
  â”‚                          â”œâ”€â”€â†’ Agent A
  â”‚                          â”œâ”€â”€â†’ Agent B
  â”‚                          â””â”€â”€â†’ Agent C
  â””â”€ Worker Agents (block)   â”€â”€â†’ Parallel Block
```

## Tips & Best Practices

1. **Start Simple**: Use block-level connections for initial design, then switch to agent-level for optimization
2. **Visual Clarity**: Agent-level connections use dashed blue lines to stand out from block connections
3. **Toggle Freely**: You can switch between modes at any time without losing connections
4. **Connection Handles**: In advanced mode, agents are listed in order, making it easy to wire them up
5. **Delete Connections**: Click the small circle in the middle of any connection line to remove it
6. **Plan Data Flow**: Consider which agents produce critical data that needs specific routing

## Future Enhancements

- [ ] Connection validation (prevent circular dependencies)
- [ ] Auto-layout for complex graphs
- [ ] Connection labels/annotations
- [ ] Conditional routing based on agent output
- [ ] Execution trace visualization along connections
- [ ] Connection grouping/bundling for cleaner visuals

## Technical Details

### Curved Connector Algorithm
Connections use **cubic Bezier curves** (SVG path with C command) for smooth, flexible routing:

```javascript
// Adaptive curve based on flow direction
const isVertical = Math.abs(dy) > Math.abs(dx);

if (isVertical) {
  // Vertical flow - curve smoothly up/down
  curveOffset = Math.abs(dy) * 0.4;
  controlPoint1 = (sourceX, sourceY + curveOffset)
  controlPoint2 = (targetX, targetY - curveOffset)
} else {
  // Horizontal flow - curve smoothly left/right
  curveOffset = Math.abs(dx) * 0.4;
  controlPoint1 = (sourceX + curveOffset, sourceY)
  controlPoint2 = (targetX - curveOffset, targetY)
}
```

**Benefits:**
- Adapts to block positioning automatically
- Reduces visual clutter by avoiding overlaps
- Natural flow direction indication
- Professional appearance

### Connection Position Calculation
- **Block-level source**: Bottom-center of source block (150px offset)
- **Block-level target**: Top-center of target block (150px offset)
- **Agent-level source**: Right edge at agent position (300px + agent index * 35px)
- **Agent-level target**: Left edge at agent position (0px + agent index * 35px)

### Zoom & Pan Support
All connection coordinates are transformed based on current zoom level and pan offset:
```javascript
x = blockX * zoom + panOffset.x + handleOffset
y = blockY * zoom + panOffset.y + handleOffset
```

### Event Handling
- Connections are rendered in an SVG overlay (z-index: 10, above blocks)
- Connection handles have `pointerEvents: 'all'` for click interaction
- Connection lines have `pointerEvents: 'none'` except for delete button
- `e.stopPropagation()` prevents conflicts with block dragging
- Delete button positioned at curve midpoint with larger hit area (r=12px)

## Styling Details

### Dark Mode Support
- Block connections: `#888` (dark) / `#666` (light)
- Agent connections: `#90caf9` (dark) / `#1976d2` (light)
- Connection handles: `#666` (inactive) / `#90caf9` (active in dark)
- Delete button: Matches connection color with semi-transparent background (opacity: 0.95)

### Line Styles
- Block connections: Solid curved lines (strokeWidth: 2px)
- Agent connections: Dashed curved lines (strokeDasharray: '8,4', strokeWidth: 2.5px)
- Both use cubic Bezier curves for smooth, professional appearance
- Delete button: Larger (r=12px), bold minus icon (strokeWidth: 2.5px)

### Responsive Design
- Connection handles scale on hover (transform: scale(1.3))
- Smooth transitions (0.2s) on all interactive elements
- Tooltip feedback for all clickable handles
- Success snackbar confirms connection creation
- Curves adapt dynamically to zoom and pan transformations
