```bash
# Seed all sample designs (includes all three)
cd claude-workflow-manager/backend
python seed_orchestration_designs.py

# Or seed individually
python seed_simple_code_editor_design.py   # Design 9
python seed_fast_code_editor_design.py     # Design 10
python seed_parallel_code_editor_design.py # Design 11
```

## In the UI

All three designs will appear in the Code Editor's orchestration dropdown:

```
Select Design:
  ├─ Simple Code Editor (2 agents) - Balanced
  ├─ Fast Code Editor (1 agent) - Quick ← Default
  └─ Parallel Code Editor (5 agents) - Batch 🚀
```

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements:
- [ ] **Auto-selection**: UI suggests design based on task complexity
- [ ] **Hybrid mode**: Fast agent can escalate to full analysis if needed
- [ ] **Streaming**: Show agent thinking in real-time
- [ ] **Retry logic**: Automatically retry with full design if fast fails

## Result

You now have **three optimized code editor designs**:

✅ **Simple Code Editor (Design 9)** - Thorough, 2-agent analysis  
✅ **Fast Code Editor (Design 10)** - Lightning-fast, single-agent  
✅ **Parallel Code Editor (Design 11)** - Ultra-fast, 4x parallelism for batch operations  

Choose based on your needs:
- **1 complex task** → Simple (quality)
- **1 simple task** → Fast (speed)
- **20+ tasks** → Parallel (4x faster!) 🚀

The parallel design is **game-changing** for batch operations! 🎯
