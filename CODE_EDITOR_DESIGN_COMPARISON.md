## Recommendations

### Start with Fast Code Editor (Design 10)
For most day-to-day tasks, the Fast Code Editor is sufficient and much quicker.

### Switch to Simple Code Editor (Design 9) When:
- Fast Code Editor's output seems rushed
- Task is more complex than expected
- You need detailed analysis
- Quality is critical

### Pro Tip
You can test with Fast Code Editor first. If unsatisfied with the result:
1. Reject the change
2. Switch to Simple Code Editor
3. Make the same request

## Configuration

Both designs are included in the seed file:

```bash
# Seed all sample designs (includes both)
cd claude-workflow-manager/backend
python seed_orchestration_designs.py

# Or seed individually
python seed_simple_code_editor_design.py  # Design 9
python seed_fast_code_editor_design.py    # Design 10
```

## In the UI

Both designs will appear in the Code Editor's orchestration dropdown:

```
Select Design:
  ‚îú‚îÄ Simple Code Editor (2 agents)
  ‚îî‚îÄ Fast Code Editor (1 agent) ‚Üê Default for speed
```

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements:
- [ ] **Auto-selection**: UI suggests design based on task complexity
- [ ] **Hybrid mode**: Fast agent can escalate to full analysis if needed
- [ ] **Streaming**: Show agent thinking in real-time
- [ ] **Retry logic**: Automatically retry with full design if fast fails

## Result

You now have **two optimized code editor designs**:

‚úÖ **Simple Code Editor** - Thorough, 2-agent analysis  
‚úÖ **Fast Code Editor** - Lightning-fast, single-agent  

Choose based on your needs: **quality vs speed**! üöÄ
