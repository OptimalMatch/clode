# NewCodeEditorPage - AI Assistant & Diff View Features

## Summary

Successfully integrated full AI Assistant and diff view features from `CodeEditorPage.tsx` into `NewCodeEditorPage.tsx`.

## Features Integrated

### 1. **AI Assistant (Chat Interface)**
Located in the left sidebar when "AI Assistant" is selected in the activity bar:

- **Orchestration Design Selector**: Choose from available orchestration designs (e.g., "Code Editor Assistant")
- **Real-time Chat Interface**: 
  - User, agent, and system messages with distinct avatars
  - Auto-scroll to latest messages
  - Message timestamps
  - Support for multi-line input
- **Execution Controls**:
  - Send button to start AI execution
  - Stop button to abort ongoing execution
  - Linear progress indicator during execution
  - Current agent status display

### 2. **Full Orchestration Execution System**

#### Core Functions Added:
- `executeDesignWithStreaming()` - Main orchestration executor
- `buildExecutionOrder()` - Topological sort for block execution order
- `getBlockInputs()` - Get outputs from connected blocks
- `executeBlockSequential()` - Execute sequential blocks
- `executeBlockParallel()` - Execute parallel blocks
- `executeBlockRouting()` - Execute routing blocks
- `executeSequentialWithStreaming()` - SSE streaming for sequential execution
- `executeParallelWithStreaming()` - SSE streaming for parallel execution
- `executeRoutingWithStreaming()` - SSE streaming for routing execution

#### Features:
- **Multi-block execution**: Executes orchestration designs with multiple connected blocks
- **Streaming responses**: Real-time agent output via Server-Sent Events (SSE)
- **Context injection**: Automatically injects workflow context and editor tool instructions
- **Abort support**: Cancel execution mid-stream
- **Error handling**: Graceful error messages and recovery

### 3. **Automatic Diff View**

When AI makes file changes, the diff view automatically activates showing:

#### Diff Toolbar Features:
- **Operation indicator**: Shows CREATE/UPDATE/DELETE
- **View modes**:
  - **Individual mode**: Navigate through changes one-by-one
  - **Combined mode**: See cumulative effect of all changes
- **Navigation**: Previous/Next buttons when multiple changes exist
- **Diff rendering modes**:
  - Inline view
  - Side-by-side view
- **Action buttons**:
  - Accept (approve and apply changes)
  - Reject (discard changes)

#### Automatic Behavior:
- Watches for pending changes on the currently open file
- Automatically switches to diff view when changes detected
- Deduplicates identical changes
- Sorts changes chronologically for proper sequential application

### 4. **Changes Polling**

During AI execution:
- Polls for file changes every 3 seconds
- Updates the changes list in real-time
- Shows animated badge count when new changes arrive
- Continues polling until execution completes

### 5. **Editor Tool Context**

AI agents are automatically configured with:
- Workflow ID for all file operations
- Explicit instructions to use `editor_*` MCP tools
- Available tool list (editor_browse_directory, editor_read_file, editor_create_change, etc.)
- Critical warnings to NEVER use generic file tools

## Key Integration Points

### State Management
All necessary state variables were already present in NewCodeEditorPage:
- `orchestrationDesigns`
- `selectedDesign`
- `chatMessages`
- `chatInput`
- `executionStatus`
- `showDiff`
- `diffChange`
- `pendingChangesForFile`
- `changeViewMode`
- `diffViewMode`

### UI Components
The UI was already fully built with:
- Activity bar with chat icon
- Sidebar chat panel
- Diff view toolbar with all controls
- Monaco DiffEditor integration
- Message display with avatars

### What Was Added
The main addition was the **orchestration execution logic** that was previously just a placeholder. The `handleSendMessage()` function and all its supporting execution functions were brought over from CodeEditorPage.tsx.

## Usage

1. **Select a repository** from the top toolbar
2. **Open the AI Assistant** by clicking the robot icon in the activity bar
3. **Select an orchestration design** (e.g., "Code Editor Assistant")
4. **Type a request** in the chat input (e.g., "Add error handling to auth.py")
5. **Click Send** to execute
6. **Watch real-time progress** as agents work
7. **Review changes** in the automatic diff view
8. **Accept or Reject** each change

## Technical Details

### SSE Event Types
- `status`: Agent execution status updates
- `chunk`: Streaming text output from agents
- `complete`: Execution completed successfully
- `error`: Execution error

### Change Management
- Changes are stored with unique IDs
- Duplicate detection by change_id and content
- Sequential application in chronological order
- Combined view shows original → final state

### Error Handling
- Abort controller for cancellation
- Network error recovery
- Parse error handling for SSE events
- User-friendly error messages

## Architecture

```
User Input → handleSendMessage()
    ↓
executeDesignWithStreaming()
    ↓
buildExecutionOrder() → [block1, block2, ...]
    ↓
For each block:
    ↓
    executeBlock[Sequential|Parallel|Routing]()
        ↓
        executeWithStreaming() → SSE stream
            ↓
            Update UI (chat messages, status)
            ↓
            Poll for changes
    ↓
Complete → Load final changes → Show in diff view
```

## Files Modified

- `claude-workflow-manager/frontend/src/components/NewCodeEditorPage.tsx`
  - Added full orchestration execution functions
  - Enhanced handleSendMessage() with real execution logic
  - All UI components and state management were already in place

## Testing Recommendations

1. Test sequential execution with 1 agent
2. Test sequential execution with 2+ agents
3. Test parallel execution with multiple agents
4. Test routing execution with router + specialists
5. Test multi-block designs with connections
6. Test abort functionality mid-execution
7. Test combined vs individual change views
8. Test inline vs side-by-side diff views
9. Test accept/reject of changes
10. Test changes polling during long executions

## Future Enhancements

- Add syntax highlighting in chat messages for code blocks
- Add ability to regenerate a response
- Add conversation history save/load
- Add voice input for chat
- Add file attachment support
- Add diff conflict resolution UI
- Add bulk change management (apply all, reject all)
- Add change preview before execution
