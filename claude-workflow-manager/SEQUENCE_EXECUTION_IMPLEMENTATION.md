# 🎯 Sequence Execution Implementation - Complete!

## ✅ **Successfully Implemented - All Three Execution Modes**

We've successfully implemented comprehensive sequence execution control in the Claude Workflow Manager, enabling users to execute workflows with precise granularity.

## 🚀 **Three Execution Modes Delivered**

### **1. 🎯 Single Sequence Only**
- **What it does**: Runs only the prompts in the selected sequence and stops
- **How to use**: Click the "Run This Sequence Only" button on any sequence group
- **Backend**: `start_sequence=X, end_sequence=X`
- **Example**: Sequence 2 only → runs 2A, 2B, 2C, 2D and stops

### **2. 🚀 From Sequence Onward**
- **What it does**: Starts at the selected sequence and runs all subsequent sequences
- **How to use**: Click "Run From This Sequence Onward" in the properties panel
- **Backend**: `start_sequence=X, end_sequence=None`
- **Example**: From Sequence 2 onward → runs 2A, 2B, 2C, 2D, then 3A, 3B, etc.

### **3. 🎯 Full Workflow**
- **What it does**: Runs the entire workflow from beginning to end
- **How to use**: Click "Run Entire Workflow" or don't specify sequence parameters
- **Backend**: `start_sequence=None, end_sequence=None`
- **Example**: Full workflow → runs all sequences 1, 2, 3, 4, 5...

## 🛠️ **Backend Implementation**

### **📊 Models Enhanced (`backend/models.py`)**
```python
class SpawnInstanceRequest(BaseModel):
    workflow_id: str
    prompt_id: Optional[str] = None
    git_repo: Optional[str] = None
    start_sequence: Optional[int] = None  # Which sequence to start from
    end_sequence: Optional[int] = None    # Which sequence to end at

class ClaudeInstance(BaseModel):
    # ... existing fields ...
    start_sequence: Optional[int] = None  # Which sequence to start from
    end_sequence: Optional[int] = None    # Which sequence to end at
```

### **🎛️ API Endpoint Enhanced (`backend/main.py`)**
```python
@app.post("/api/instances/spawn")
async def spawn_instance(request: SpawnInstanceRequest):
    """
    Execution Modes:
    - Full workflow: start_sequence=None, end_sequence=None
    - Single sequence: start_sequence=X, end_sequence=X
    - From sequence onward: start_sequence=X, end_sequence=None
    """
```

### **⚙️ Execution Logic (`backend/claude_manager.py`)**
```python
async def _auto_execute_sequences(self, instance: 'ClaudeInstance'):
    """Auto-execute sequences if sequence parameters are provided"""
    if instance.start_sequence is not None or instance.end_sequence is not None:
        # Get filtered execution plan
        execution_plan = file_manager.get_execution_plan(
            start_sequence=instance.start_sequence,
            end_sequence=instance.end_sequence
        )
        # Execute the filtered prompts automatically
```

### **📋 Execution Plan Filtering (`backend/prompt_file_manager.py`)**
```python
def get_execution_plan(self, start_sequence: int = None, end_sequence: int = None):
    """
    Filter sequences based on start/end parameters
    - start_sequence: Optional sequence number to start from
    - end_sequence: Optional sequence number to end at
    """
```

## 🎨 **Frontend Implementation**

### **🔗 API Client Enhanced (`frontend/src/services/api.ts`)**
```typescript
export const instanceApi = {
  spawn: async (
    workflowId: string, 
    promptId?: string, 
    gitRepo?: string, 
    startSequence?: number,  // ← Added
    endSequence?: number     // ← Added
  ) => {
    const response = await api.post('/api/instances/spawn', {
      workflow_id: workflowId,
      prompt_id: promptId,
      git_repo: gitRepo,
      start_sequence: startSequence,  // ← Added
      end_sequence: endSequence,      // ← Added
    });
    return response.data;
  }
}
```

### **🎮 Interactive UI (`frontend/src/components/DesignPage.tsx`)**

#### **Sequence Node Actions:**
```typescript
// Single sequence execution
const result = await instanceApi.spawn(
  workflowId,
  undefined, // no specific prompt
  undefined, // no git repo override
  sequenceNumber, // start at this sequence
  sequenceNumber  // end at this sequence
);

// From sequence onward execution
const result = await instanceApi.spawn(
  workflowId,
  undefined, // no specific prompt
  undefined, // no git repo override
  sequenceNumber, // start at this sequence
  undefined // no end sequence (run to end)
);

// Full workflow execution
const result = await instanceApi.spawn(workflowId);
```

#### **Enhanced Properties Panel:**
For sequence groups, users now see three execution options:
1. **"Run This Sequence Only"** (Green, primary button)
2. **"Run From This Sequence Onward"** (Blue, outlined button)
3. **"Run Entire Workflow"** (Gray, outlined button)

## 🎯 **User Experience**

### **🖱️ Quick Actions (Node Play Buttons)**
- **Sequence nodes**: Click play button → "Run just this sequence and stop"
- **Prompt nodes**: Click play button → "Run this prompt only"
- **Tooltips**: Honest and descriptive

### **🎛️ Advanced Actions (Properties Panel)**
When you click on a sequence group:
1. **Properties panel opens** with sequence details
2. **Three execution buttons** for different modes
3. **Clear descriptions** of what each mode does
4. **Visual feedback** with loading states and notifications

### **📱 Real-time Feedback**
- **Toast notifications** for each execution mode:
  - `✨ Sequence 2 started!` (single sequence)
  - `🚀 Execution from sequence 2 onward started!` (from sequence onward)
  - `🎯 Full workflow started!` (entire workflow)
- **Automatic navigation** to instances page for monitoring
- **Visual status indicators** on nodes (success/error chips)

## 🧪 **Testing Scenarios**

### **Test Case 1: Single Sequence**
```
1. Select workflow with sequences 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
2. Click sequence 3 → "Run This Sequence Only"
3. Expected: Only prompts 3A, 3B, 3C execute
4. Verify: Execution stops after sequence 3
```

### **Test Case 2: From Sequence Onward**
```
1. Select workflow with sequences 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
2. Click sequence 3 → "Run From This Sequence Onward"
3. Expected: Prompts 3A, 3B, 3C, 4A, 4B, 5A, 5B execute
4. Verify: Starts at sequence 3, continues to end
```

### **Test Case 3: Full Workflow**
```
1. Select workflow with sequences 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
2. Click any sequence → "Run Entire Workflow"
3. Expected: All prompts from all sequences execute
4. Verify: Complete workflow execution from start to finish
```

### **Test Case 4: Individual Prompt**
```
1. Select workflow with sequences 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
2. Click individual prompt (e.g., 2B) → Play button
3. Expected: Only prompt 2B executes
4. Verify: Single prompt execution, no other prompts run
```
