# GitHub Actions Runner - Docker Setup Guide

## The Right Way: Add User to Docker Group

Instead of using `sudo docker`, the proper approach is to add the GitHub Actions runner user to the `docker` group. This follows Docker security best practices.

## One-Time Setup on Your Self-Hosted Runner

Run these commands **once** on your self-hosted runner machine (pop-os-1):

### 1. Find the Runner User

```bash
# Check which user runs the GitHub Actions runner
ps aux | grep "Runner.Listener"

# Typically it's:
# - ubuntu
# - github-runner
# - runner
# - your username
```

### 2. Add User to Docker Group

```bash
# Replace 'github-runner' with your actual runner username
sudo usermod -aG docker github-runner

# Verify the user was added
groups github-runner
```

### 3. Restart the Runner Service

**Option A: If using systemd service**
```bash
sudo systemctl restart actions.runner.*.service
```

**Option B: If running as screen/tmux session**
```bash
# Exit the current runner session and restart it
# Or reboot the machine
sudo reboot
```

**Option C: Simple logout/login**
```bash
# Log out and log back in
# Or use:
newgrp docker
```

### 4. Verify Docker Access

```bash
# Switch to runner user
sudo su - github-runner

# Test Docker without sudo
docker ps
docker --version
docker compose version

# If these work without sudo, you're good! ‚úÖ
```

## Why This Approach is Better

### ‚ùå Using `sudo docker` (Bad)
- Requires sudoers configuration
- Security risk (gives runner elevated privileges)
- Can create root-owned files causing permission issues
- Not the standard Docker practice
- Complicates CI/CD pipeline

### ‚úÖ Using Docker group (Good)
- Standard Docker installation practice
- No elevated privileges needed
- Follows least-privilege principle
- Cleaner CI/CD scripts
- Industry best practice
- Docker creates files as the user, not root

## Current Workflow Configuration

After the fix, the workflow now:

**‚úÖ Docker commands (no sudo):**
- `docker compose down`
- `docker compose up`
- `docker system prune`
- `docker login`

**‚úÖ File operations (with sudo, only when needed):**
- `sudo rm -rf` - To delete Docker-created files
- `sudo chown` - To fix ownership after copying

This is the **correct balance**:
- Docker commands run as the user (in docker group)
- Only file cleanup operations use sudo (for Docker-created root files)

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: "permission denied while trying to connect to Docker daemon"

**Solution:**
```bash
# 1. Check if user is in docker group
groups $USER

# 2. If not, add them
sudo usermod -aG docker $USER

# 3. Log out and back in, or use:
newgrp docker

# 4. Verify
docker ps
```

### Issue: "Cannot connect to the Docker daemon"

**Solution:**
```bash
# Check if Docker service is running
sudo systemctl status docker

# Start it if needed
sudo systemctl start docker
sudo systemctl enable docker
```

### Issue: Files still owned by root after Docker operations

This is **normal** and expected. Docker containers sometimes create files as root. That's why we keep `sudo rm -rf` and `sudo chown` in the workflow for file operations.

**Solution:** The workflow now handles this with:
```bash
sudo rm -rf claude-workflow-manager || true
sudo chown -R $USER:$USER claude-workflow-manager
```

## Security Considerations

### Is adding users to the docker group safe?

**Important to know:**
- Users in the `docker` group have **root-equivalent** privileges
- They can mount volumes, run containers as root, etc.
- Only add **trusted users** (like your CI/CD runner)

### Best practices:
1. ‚úÖ Use dedicated runner user (not your personal account)
2. ‚úÖ Limit who has access to the runner machine
3. ‚úÖ Keep Docker and runner software updated
4. ‚úÖ Monitor runner logs for suspicious activity
5. ‚úÖ Use GitHub's runner security features (runner groups, labels)

## Alternative: Docker Rootless Mode

For even better security, consider **Docker Rootless Mode**:

```bash
# Install Docker in rootless mode
dockerd-rootless-setuptool.sh install

# This allows running Docker without adding user to docker group
# and without needing root privileges at all
```

**Pros:**
- No root access needed
- Better security isolation
- No sudo required

**Cons:**
- Some features limited
- Requires additional setup
- May have networking complications

## Verification Checklist

After setup, verify:

- [ ] Runner user is in docker group: `groups <runner-user>`
- [ ] Can run `docker ps` without sudo
- [ ] Can run `docker compose` without sudo
- [ ] GitHub Actions workflow runs without permission errors
- [ ] Docker creates files that can be cleaned up

## Quick Reference

```bash
# Setup (one-time)
sudo usermod -aG docker <runner-user>
sudo systemctl restart actions.runner.*.service

# Verify
docker ps                    # Should work without sudo
docker compose version       # Should work without sudo
groups $USER                 # Should show: docker

# If needed
newgrp docker               # Refresh groups without logout
sudo systemctl status docker # Check Docker daemon status
```

## Summary

‚úÖ **Correct approach:**
- Runner user in `docker` group
- Docker commands run without sudo
- Only file operations use sudo when necessary

‚ùå **Avoid:**
- Using `sudo docker` in workflows
- Running runner as root user
- Giving runner unnecessary sudo privileges

This is the **industry-standard** way to configure Docker for CI/CD runners! üéâ
