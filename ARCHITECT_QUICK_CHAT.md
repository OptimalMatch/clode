# Architect Quick Chat Feature

## Overview
Added a floating quick chat interface to the Orchestration Designer page that provides immediate access to the AI Architect without requiring users to click the Architect button first.

## Implementation Details

### New State Variables
- `quickChatExpanded`: Controls whether the chat panel is expanded or collapsed
- `quickChatPrompt`: Stores the user's input in the quick chat

### Key Features

#### 1. **Floating Chat Button**
- Always visible at the bottom-right corner of the screen
- Circular button with SmartToy icon
- Smooth animations when expanding/collapsing
- Gradient styling matching the main Architect branding

#### 2. **Expandable Chat Panel**
- Expands to 420x500px when opened
- Collapses to a 60x60px circular button
- Smooth transitions using CSS animations
- High z-index (1100) to stay above other content

#### 3. **Smart Mode Detection**
- Automatically detects if the design board is empty or has content
- Empty board → "Create New Design" mode
- Has blocks → "Improve Design" mode
- Mode indicator chip displayed at the top of the chat

#### 4. **Interactive Features**
- Real-time streaming output during generation
- Shows generation status and elapsed time
- Clickable prompt suggestions based on current mode
- Different suggestions for create vs. improve modes
- Keyboard shortcuts: Enter to send, Shift+Enter for new line

#### 5. **Prompt Suggestions**

**Create Mode (Empty Board):**
- "Create a sequential workflow for data processing"
- "Build a parallel task executor with 3 workers"
- "Design a debate system with moderator"

**Improve Mode (Has Blocks):**
- "Add error handling to all agents"
- "Add a reflection agent to review outputs"
- "Optimize agent prompts for better performance"

#### 6. **Generation Handler**
- `handleQuickChatGenerate()`: New async function
- Reuses the existing AI generation infrastructure
- Auto-detects mode based on `blocks.length`
- Clears prompt after successful generation
- Shows success/error notifications

### UI/UX Improvements

1. **Dark Mode Support**: Fully supports the existing dark mode theme
2. **Responsive Design**: Works well with different screen sizes
3. **Visual Feedback**: 
   - Loading spinner during generation
   - Monospace font for streaming output
   - Color-coded mode indicators
4. **Accessibility**: Tooltips, proper button states, keyboard navigation

### Integration Points

- Uses existing `orchestrationDesignApi.generateWithAI()` method
- Shares state variables with the main Architect dialog
- Respects existing dark mode settings
- Integrates with the notification system

### Benefits

1. **Reduced Friction**: Users can start interacting with the Architect immediately
2. **Better Visibility**: The floating button makes the Architect feature more discoverable
3. **Context Awareness**: Automatically adjusts mode based on current design state
4. **Persistent Access**: Always available without needing to navigate through menus
