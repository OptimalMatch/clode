## Tips for Creating Effective Agents

### 1. Be Specific in System Prompts
❌ Bad: "You are a developer"  
✅ Good: "You are a senior Python developer specializing in data engineering. Focus on efficient data pipelines, proper error handling, and scalable solutions."

### 2. Define Clear Responsibilities
Each agent should have a distinct, well-defined role. Avoid overlap between agents.

### 3. Set the Right Tone
Match the agent's tone to the task:
- Technical tasks: Professional, precise
- Creative tasks: Expressive, innovative
- Reviews: Constructive, balanced

### 4. Include Task-Specific Instructions
- **Sequential**: Each agent should expect input from previous agent
- **Debate**: Agents should respond to opposing arguments
- **Hierarchical**: Manager delegates, workers execute specific subtasks
- **Parallel**: All agents work independently on same task
- **Routing**: Router analyzes, specialists execute

### 5. Test and Iterate
Start with simple prompts and refine based on results. The best prompts come from iteration.

## Combining Patterns

You can chain orchestration patterns for complex workflows:

1. **Route** the request to appropriate specialists
2. Run specialists in **Parallel** 
3. **Hierarchical** manager synthesizes results
4. **Sequential** pipeline refines the output

Example: Content production → Code review → Publishing workflow

## Best Practices

1. **Keep agents focused**: One clear responsibility per agent
2. **Provide context**: Include relevant background in the task
3. **Set expectations**: Tell agents what format or style you want
4. **Use appropriate roles**: Match role to function (manager, worker, specialist)
5. **Iterate on prompts**: Refine based on results
6. **Monitor costs**: More agents = more API calls = higher cost
7. **Start simple**: Begin with 2-3 agents, expand as needed

## Common Pitfalls

1. ❌ Too many agents (diminishing returns, higher cost)
2. ❌ Vague system prompts (unclear agent behavior)
3. ❌ Overlapping responsibilities (redundant work)
4. ❌ Wrong pattern for the task (use debate for analysis, not code generation)
5. ❌ No aggregation in parallel (missing synthesis step)
6. ❌ Complex tasks without breakdown (hierarchical can help)

## Getting Help

If you're unsure which pattern to use:

- **Sequential**: When order matters and each step builds on the previous
- **Debate**: When you need multiple perspectives or critical analysis
- **Hierarchical**: When task can be decomposed into independent subtasks
- **Parallel**: When you want diverse approaches to the same problem
- **Routing**: When different tasks need different specialists

Start with the simplest pattern that fits your use case!
