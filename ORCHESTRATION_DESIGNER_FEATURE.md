# Orchestration Designer - Visual Multi-Agent Workflow Builder

## Overview

The **Orchestration Designer** is a new visual page that allows you to design complex multi-agent orchestration workflows by dragging and dropping orchestration patterns onto a canvas, connecting them, and customizing each pattern with specific agents, prompts, and configurations.

## Features

### 1. Visual Canvas with Drag-and-Drop
- **Interactive Canvas**: A grid-based canvas where you can visually design your orchestration workflows
- **Pattern Library**: Sidebar with all 5 orchestration patterns available for drag-and-drop
- **Zoom Controls**: Zoom in/out and reset view for better navigation
- **Pan & Zoom**: Navigate large workflows easily

### 2. Five Orchestration Patterns

#### ðŸ”„ Sequential Pipeline
- **Description**: Agents work in series (A â†’ B â†’ C)
- **Use Case**: Multi-stage processing where each agent's output feeds into the next
- **Example**: Research â†’ Write â†’ Edit

#### âš¡ Parallel Execution
- **Description**: Multiple agents work simultaneously on the same task
- **Use Case**: Getting diverse perspectives or parallel processing
- **Example**: Multiple specialists analyzing the same problem

#### ðŸ‘” Hierarchical Delegation
- **Description**: Manager agent delegates to worker agents and synthesizes results
- **Use Case**: Complex tasks requiring division of labor
- **Example**: Project manager delegating to developers, designers, and QA

#### ðŸ’¬ Debate/Discussion
- **Description**: Agents discuss and argue different perspectives
- **Use Case**: Exploring multiple viewpoints or decision-making
- **Example**: Two agents debating pros/cons with a moderator

#### ðŸŽ¯ Dynamic Routing
- **Description**: Router agent analyzes task and routes to appropriate specialists
- **Use Case**: Intelligent task routing based on content
- **Example**: Support router directing to different specialists

### 3. Pattern Customization via Drawer Panel

When you click on any orchestration block, a drawer panel slides in from the right with:

#### Block Configuration
- **Label**: Custom name for the block
- **Task Description**: The task this pattern will execute
- **Git Repository**: Assign a git repository for agents to work with
- **Pattern-Specific Options**: (e.g., number of rounds for debate)

#### Agent Management
- **Add/Remove Agents**: Dynamically add or remove agents from the pattern
- **Agent Properties**:
  - **Name**: Unique identifier for the agent
  - **Role**: Worker, Manager, Specialist, or Moderator
  - **System Prompt**: Detailed instructions for the agent's behavior

### 4. Connecting Patterns

You can create complex workflows by connecting orchestration patterns:

**Example Flow:**
```
Sequential (Research Team) 
    â†“
Parallel (Multiple Analysts)
    â†“
Hierarchical (Manager + Workers)
    â†“
Router (Specialist Selection)
    â†“
Sequential (Final Processing)
```

**Connection Features:**
- Click "Connect" on a source block
- Click on a target block to complete the connection
- Visual arrows show the flow direction
- Click the circle in the middle of a connection line to delete it

### 5. Git Repository Integration

Each orchestration block can be assigned a git repository:
- Select from existing workflows' repositories
- Agents in that block will have access to the repository
- Useful for code-related tasks, documentation, or file operations

### 6. Save and Load Designs

#### Saving
- Click "Save Design" button in the header
- Enter a name and description
- Design is saved to the database with all blocks, connections, and configurations

#### Loading (Coming Soon)
- Load previously saved designs
- Continue working on existing orchestration workflows

### 7. Execution (Planned Feature)

The execution functionality will:
1. Traverse the blocks in order based on connections
2. Execute each orchestration pattern sequentially or in parallel
3. Pass outputs between connected blocks
4. Show real-time progress and results

   - Write system prompts defining agent behavior

### Step 4: Connect Blocks
1. Click "Connect" on the first block
2. Click the target block to create the connection
3. Repeat to build your workflow chain

### Step 5: Save Your Design
1. Click "Save Design" in the header
2. Enter a meaningful name and description
3. Your design is stored for future use

## Complex Workflow Example

### Multi-Stage Content Creation Pipeline

- Agent 2: Technical Writer
- Agent 3: Marketing Specialist
- Agent 4: SEO Expert

**Block 3: Router for Content Type**
- Router Agent decides which specialist handles which content type
- Technical Specialist
- Marketing Specialist
- Creative Specialist

**Block 4: Hierarchical Review & Polish**

## Advanced Features

### Nested Orchestrations
You can create complex patterns like:
- Sequential chain where one step is a parallel execution
- Router that leads to hierarchical delegations
- Debate followed by sequential processing of the conclusion

### Git Repository Access
Each block can access different git repositories:
- Research agents can access documentation repos
- Code agents can access source code repos
- Content agents can access content repos

## Support

For questions or issues with the Orchestration Designer:
- Check existing saved designs for examples
- Review the Agent Orchestration page to understand individual patterns
- Experiment with simple workflows before building complex ones

## Architecture Notes

The Orchestration Designer extends the existing Agent Orchestration system by:
- Providing a visual interface similar to the Workflow Designer
- Allowing composition of multiple orchestration patterns
- Storing designs separately from workflows
- Supporting future execution engine integration

The design philosophy is:
- **Simple patterns, complex combinations**: Each pattern is simple, but combining them creates powerful workflows
- **Visual first**: The visual representation should make the workflow immediately understandable
- **Git-native**: Deep integration with git repositories for code and content tasks
- **Agent-centric**: Focus on configuring agents and their interactions
